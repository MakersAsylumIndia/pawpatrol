Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Pawwered Up is a bio-inspired prosthetic leg designed to replicate the natural motion of a dogâ€™s limb using real-time sensor feedback. Built around the ESP32 XIAO C3 microcontroller, the system uses two MPU6050 motion sensors â€” one mounted on the intact leg and another on the prosthetic leg â€” to synchronize movement between them.

The sensors detect orientation and acceleration data, allowing the prosthetic legâ€™s servo motors (hip and knee) to mimic the gait of the healthy leg with precision. Powered by a rechargeable battery, the system aims to provide a low-cost, modular, and open-source assistive technology for injured or amputee dogs, emphasizing both engineering innovation and animal welfare.
