# 📘 Welcome to the IS Project Documentation Template!

Hey there! 👋

Pawwered Up is a bio-inspired prosthetic leg designed to replicate the natural motion of a dog’s limb using real-time sensor feedback. Built around the ESP32 XIAO C3 microcontroller, the system uses two MPU6050 motion sensors — one mounted on the intact leg and another on the prosthetic leg — to synchronize movement between them.

The sensors detect orientation and acceleration data, allowing the prosthetic leg’s servo motors (hip and knee) to mimic the gait of the healthy leg with precision. Powered by a rechargeable battery, the system aims to provide a low-cost, modular, and open-source assistive technology for injured or amputee dogs, emphasizing both engineering innovation and animal welfare.

## 🛠 Where to Document Everything Else

We’ve already created a standard set of [**Wiki pages**](https://github.com/MakersAsylumIndia/Bowl-Buddy/wiki) for your project in this repository — you just need to **update them with your project information**.

Each section is ready with headings like:

- Project Title
- Problem Statement
- Bill of Materials (BOM)
- Solution Overview
- SDG Goals Associated
- Circuit & CAD Files
- Media Gallery
- License

Please **do not delete the headings** — just replace the placeholder content under each.
